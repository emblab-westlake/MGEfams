# MGEfams
Fast and robust identificaiton of mobile genetic elements (MGE) genes from genomes and metagenome assemblies using MGEfams, a high-quality and manually cruated subdatabase of profile hidden Markov models for MGE genes


This subdatabase of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) consists of HMM models for MGE genes extracted from Pfam (v 30.0) 27 and TIGRFAMs databases, based on string match in their functional annotations to one of the following keywords: transposase, transposon, conjugative, integrase, integron, recombinase, resolvase, conjugal, mobilization, recombination, and plasmid, as recommended previously (Forsberg et al 2012, Forsberg et al 2014)
